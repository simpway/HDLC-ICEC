The kernel is the HDLC_ICEC_LIB.py


IC for GBTX example:
1. configure with I2C
2. change to configure with GBTX
read 3 registers:   ICOP.py -t 0 -s 0x01 -a 0x0032 -l 3 -r
write 3 registers:  ICOP.py -t 0 -s 0x01 -a 0x0032 -l 3 -w 0x070038
-t tx link number
-s I2C addr

EC for GBT-SCA example:

GBT-SCA: GPIO example
ECOP.py 0 0
ECOP1.py 1 0
ECOP2.py 2 0
(0 1 2 is the command number, ideally it should be +1 each time. But actually when we donâ€™t plus 1, the return frame will has 3 0x7E, we can process from the second one.)
second 0 is the mux selection, if the GBT-SCA return data is swappd (CRC error happens, or/and delimiter number is 1), then try 1.
